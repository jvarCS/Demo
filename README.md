This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Clone the repository so that there is a local version on your machine with the following command.

`git clone https://github.com/acm-ucr/acm-hydra.git`

Once installed, run `npm i` to install all nessecary dependencies for the project.

Next, install the following plug ins.

-   [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html) 
-   [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/)

When combined, these two extensions ensure that all code conforms to the style being used in other files while also making debugging and error catching easier.

## Important Commands

Use the following command to format code with Prettier.

`npm run write` 

To check if a file has already been formatted, enter the following.

`npm run check`

These two commands replace `npx prettier --write` and `npx prettier --check` through the use of scripts in the `package.json` file.
Similar shortcuts can be found for different commands besides Prettier commands in this file.



The following command runs ESLint.

`npm run eslint`

As with Prettier, this and all later commands are shortcuts whose original commands can be found in the `package.json` file.


For building and exporting, use the following commands.

`npm run build` and `npm run export`



## Running localhost

When working on the website, it is often helpful to be able to see the changes you've made as you're making them.
This can be achieved by running localhost and creating a temporary server for the website.
Begin by entering either of the following commands into the terminal.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Once entered, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

When you being making changes to the file you're working on, you'll see that the page updates automatically each time you save.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Next Build

Run the following command in the terminal to build

## Static Export

Because the website is hosted on UCR servers, we have to use static html files.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
